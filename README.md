♻️ EcoDispose: Smart Battery Disposal System
EcoDispose is an intelligent system that identifies whether a battery is recyclable or non-recyclable using machine learning. Designed to reduce environmental impact and promote proper e-waste disposal, 
EcoDispose streamlines battery classification and disposal through a seamless integration of barcode scanning, image analysis, and smart vendor connection.

🌟 Features
🔋 Battery Classification
Trained ML model that classifies batteries as recyclable or non-recyclable using:
Voltage levels
Manufacturer details
Barcode data
Visual inspection (image recognition)

📸 User-Friendly Frontend
Upload a battery image directly via an intuitive web interface and receive instant results.

🏭 Smart Vendor Routing
Non-recyclable batteries are automatically linked to certified vendors for safe disposal.

📦 Barcode Scanner Integration
Accurately identifies battery type and manufacturer to support classification.

🧠 How It Works
Image Upload
Users upload a picture of a battery through the frontend.
Feature Extraction
The backend extracts relevant information:
Reads barcode using a scanner or image-based decoding.
Analyzes voltage and visible markings.
Uses image-based ML techniques to detect physical traits.

Model Inference
A trained machine learning model (CNN + metadata processing) predicts whether the battery is recyclable.
Output & Action
If recyclable, the user is prompted to recycle via local collection points.
If non-recyclable, the system connects to a registered disposal vendor for pickup or drop-off instructions.
